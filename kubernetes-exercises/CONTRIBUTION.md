## Exercise structure

The exercise should have the following sections:

* Learning goals (bullet points on what the student should learn)
* Introduction (cleartext description of the exercise)
* Exercise (Step-by-step instructions on how to solve the exercise)
* Extras and wrap-up (optional)

When creating a new exercise, you should use the [exercise template](exercise-template.md) as a starting point.
## Best practices

### Hints
Use :bulb: `:bulb:` to indicate a hint to the exercise. 

### Dealing with text rich content

When ever you think there is too much text, but that it is necessary, please use the `details` tag to make the text toggleable, by clicking the arrow:

<details>
    <summary>A Hint</summary>
    It helps reducing the amount of word overload that we sometimes write
</details>

The code to make this happen is the following:

```markdown
<details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
        All markdown in here is hidden in an expandable field
</details>
```
